# Text extraction app

Automation is increasingly important when it comes to improving and optimizing practices and processes. This web application performs the automated extraction of structured data, specifically, it can capture information from image files, interpret them and convert them to structured data. The identification and automated extraction of the structured data was carried out through the use of the Form Recognizer API service provided by Microsoft Azure as part of the family of artificial intelligence services that accelerate the development of solutions for common business processes. An image was sent to the API and it returns a response after having analysed the image. The application interprets the response so that it can be downloaded in a CSV format, which is best recognized for data analysis. In this way we can implement this technology to optimize current practices in the field of data analysis.
